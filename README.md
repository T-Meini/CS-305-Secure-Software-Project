## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial, a company dealing with sensitive financial data, approached us to conduct a thorough assessment of their software's security vulnerabilities. The key requirements focused on secure communications, international transactions, addressing government restrictions, and safeguarding against external threats such as phishing, data interception, DDoS attacks, malware, and ransomware. This comprehensive approach was crucial for their business, which heavily relies on maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of financial information.

## What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

The vulnerability assessment for Artemis Financial was notably successful, identifying various weaknesses in their software. These included issues like inadequate input validation, insecure request parameter handling, and the use of outdated dependencies prone to known vulnerabilities. Secure coding practices are essential in this context, as they prevent unauthorized data access and maintain the software's integrity and availability. Secure coding adds immense value to a company like Artemis Financial by preserving client trust, ensuring regulatory compliance, and safeguarding against financial and reputational harm.

## What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

One challenge was making sure to identify each subtle security flaw and understanding their overall impact on system security. This process is crucial for a comprehensive security overhaul and requires a deep understanding of both the software in question and the landscape of potential security threats.

## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

To enhance security, the approach included implementing enchanced input validation, securing request parameters, updating database connection protocols, and introducing authentication and standard cryptographic systems. For future assessments and mitigations, staying alongside of new vulnerabilities, utilizing the latest vulnerability scanning tools, and employing both static and dynamic security testing methods are essential. These practices ensure a proactive stance against emerging security threats.

## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Ensuring that the software remained functional and secure after refactoring involved updating all dependencies to their latest versions and applying industry-standard security protocols. While specific post-refactoring checks were not detailed in the report, typically this would include comprehensive security testing, code reviews, and regression testing to confirm that no new vulnerabilities were introduced during the refactoring process.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The assessment leveraged a combination of manual reviews and static testing tools to pinpoint vulnerabilities, particularly in software dependencies. This approach was complemented by using a combination of the Dependency-Check software and a program called Snyk, which was used to help with manual review. These tools and practices are invaluable in maintaining ongoing software security and are essential components of a robust security strategy.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

For future employment opportunities, the detailed vulnerability assessment report itself stands out as a prime example of accomplished work. It highlights the thorough identification of vulnerabilities, a structured approach to mitigation, and the development of a comprehensive security plan. This report demonstrates a high level of technical proficiency, meticulous attention to detail, and a deep understanding of software security principles, all of which are highly valuable in the field of cybersecurity.
